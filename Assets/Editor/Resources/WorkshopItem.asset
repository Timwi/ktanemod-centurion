  Title: The Centurion
  Description: 'Do you dare take on The Centurion???


    This bomb case can hold a total of 101 modules on a single bomb! It is definitely
    not for the faint hearted.


    This mod also contains one mission, which features 100 regular modules, 100 minutes,
    10 strikes. Oh yes, and 1 needy! The mission has been carefully designed to require
    one of each of all of the current modded regular modules, and then fills in the
    remaining regular modules with a selection of vanilla modules (as there are not
    quite 100 modded modules currently available). The one needy can be either vanilla
    or modded. This does mean that in order to attempt this mission, you would need
    to subscribe to ALL modded modules currently available on the Steam workshop!
    It will not allow you to start unless you subscribe to every single one of them.


    That said, the mission is purely optional, and you do not need to subscribe to
    the modules in order to use the bomb casing on its own.'
