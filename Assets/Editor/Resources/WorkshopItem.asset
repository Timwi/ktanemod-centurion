  Title: The Centurion
  Description: "[b]Do you dare take on The Centurion???[/b]\r\n\r\nThis bomb case
    can hold a total of [b]101[/b] modules on a single bomb! It is definitely not
    for the faint hearted.\r\n\r\nThis mod also contains two missions. The first (and
    true) mission consists of the following:\n- 100 regular modules\r\n- 1 needy module\r\n-
    100 minutes\r\n- 10 strikes\r\n\nThe second mission is just like above, but replace
    the needy with another regular module. Not a true test of mettle, but you would
    still be regarded highly on conquering this mission.\n\r\nThe mission has been
    carefully designed to require one of each of all of the current modded regular
    modules, and then fills in the remaining regular modules with a selection of vanilla
    modules (as there are not quite 100 modded modules currently available). The one
    needy can be either vanilla or modded.\r\n\r\nThis does mean that in order to
    attempt this mission, you would need to subscribe to [b]ALL[/b] modded modules
    currently available on the Steam workshop (currently up-to and including 'Zoo').
    It will not allow you to start unless you subscribe to every single one of them.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the mission is purely optional, and you do not need to subscribe to the
    modules in order to use the bomb casing on its own.\n\nIf you ever complete a
    challenge on this bomb, please do share your successes in the discussion forums
    and comments on this workshop page :D"
